            <!-- </br> -->
            I am a computer engineering graduate and soon-to-be data science graduate with a passion for artificial intelligence, particularly neural networks, data analysis, and cybersecurity. Determined to excel in these constantly evolving fields, I regularly attend weekly data science seminars to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and developments.

                I love working with computers â€” it's both my hobby and profession. I am particularly fascinated by the Internet and how it works, and I am comfortable working on web applications, both frontend and backend. I have also worked on smartphone apps, both native and hybrid, and have experience with Linux system administration. Additionally, I have a keen interest in securing information systems and building secure systems.

I promote, support and use free and open source software to the extent possible. -->
